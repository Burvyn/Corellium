"Help! Discord is blocked on my school Chromebook and I can’t access the proxies!"
Chill, you probably only need one proxy anyway. You don’t need a whole damn army of them.

"But what if it gets banned?"
If it gets banned, whatever, get a backup or two. You don’t need 1000 proxies, calm down.

"Okay, but I don’t have any unblocked proxies anymore!"
Don’t freak out. Just use another damn device to access Discord. It’s not rocket science.

"But I’m only 12 and my parents blocked Discord because I need to be at least 13!"
Classic. If you’re really desperate, just search “School Chromebook proxy 2025” on YouTube. You’ll figure it out.

"But the word proxy is blocked!"
Well, shit. Try using Russian, that worked for me. If it’s blocked everywhere, at least give it a shot.

"But my school has detections for all languages!"
Okay, damn, that sucks. Use your phone, it probably isn’t blocked there... yet.

"It’s not working!"
That’s annoying as hell, but fine. I’ll just drop a proxy link on GitHub for you. Relax, you got this.

"But I don’t have a GitHub account!"
Are you serious? Make one, it’s free. Don’t tell me you’re too lazy for that.

"But it’s blocked on my Chromebook!"
Then open it on your damn phone. Sign up there, it’s not that complicated.

"But I’m only 11 and my parents banned me from signing up for GitHub for the same reason as Discord!"
Alright, I get it. Just ask a friend or someone at school. People help out, trust me.

"But I have no friends!"
Damn, that sucks. But hey, maybe it’s time to make some. Or ask someone in class for help, they won’t bite.

"But no one wants to help!"
Fine, be your own damn hero. Learn to make proxies yourself. It’s 2025, you can figure it out. Just create a temp GitHub account, and delete it if you need to.

"But I’m stu-!"
YES, YOU ARE! Now stop whining and get shit done. The world doesn’t give a damn about your excuses.
